# simplepush-python-demo
A small project to learn how to use a third party service called simplepush in different contexts.

In case it matters, I'm running this with python-dev on the Ubuntu for Windows thing in Windows 10.

There's a service I found called Simplepush, it allows you to push both encrypted and unencrypted alerts to your android phone. I decided
it would be a good idea to make a small demo app.
